            Here is a little bit about me:<br><br>
            
            My journey with having a passion with technology and gaming started from a very young age.<br><br>

            Both my parents were gamers, and while they weren't tech professionals, they did take and interest
            in the field at the consumer level. Thanks to them, I began playing video games as soon as I could hold a controller.

            From there, my interest grew and I had the pleasure of starting on a Sega Genesis, then moving on to have my very own
            Super Nintendo at the age of 3--that I didn't even have to share! Around the same time, my mother bought our first computer
            and I took a liking to playing games on that as well.<br><br>

            Through Elementary and Jr. High I was constantly learning how to properly type, use shortcuts, and learn basic troubleshooting
            for both Windows and Mac. It was at age 11 I learned HTML to build websites to showcase art of my favorite anime, manga, and
            video game characters. I flourished, teaching my friends how they too could create websites, add images, add video, and even
            have obnoxiously loud music play upon loading the site.<br><br>

            It was not until I was in High School that I realized the joy of PC gaming. I was mainly console for a long time with my attention
            split between Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. PC gaming offered me a chance to connect with others more thoroughly in a way that felt
            more like home to me.<br><br>

            After many years of PC gaming, I suppose I still wasn't convinced that the tech field was right for me. I dabbled in many fields, including
            Medical Assisting, Acting, Modeling, Art, Music, and Theatre. While these were fun, they still did not speak to me in the way I felt I needed.
            Through many elective courses, I realized I always somehow stayed connected to the tech field in some way, namely coding.<br><br>

            I, after so many years, finally realized where I belonged. I obtained my Associate of the Arts in Information Technology in 2019, then went on to
            obtain both a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology and a Certificate in Advanced Software Development from the University of Phoenix in 2022.
            I now hold a Master's Degree in Data Science as of August of 2024.<br><br>

            Most recently, I worked at a small MITS as an Administrative Assistant, but I did wear many hats that have lead to me dabbling in Helpdesk, Data Science,
            Database Management, Web Development, and Software Development. What I lack in experience, I make up for in a thirst for knowledge and an ability to
            catch onto concepts in a ridiculously short amount of time. I am constantly learning, and ready to take on any challenege thrown at me.<br><br>
